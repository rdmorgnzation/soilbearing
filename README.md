More Details
==========
This program takes SPT borehole data(excel sheet) and compute BC(Bearing Capacity) using various methods. Those include, by shear criteria, deflection criteria and outputs that can be used by external programs. This includes libray, some scripts, jupyter notebooks (sample calculation and other information), program with UI(for easy access), django server.

For documentation the notebooks are supposed to provide use cases and they may be used for test cases too.
