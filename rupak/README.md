BLCalc
==========
This is the program to calculate bearing capacity directly from Excel Sheets(containing SPT datas).

More Details
==========
This program takes SPT borehole data(excel sheet[, may later summary sheets too]) and compute BC(Bearing Capacity) using various methods. Those include, by shear criteria, deflection criteria [and FEM (PLASIX)] and outputs that can be used by external programs. It's target ia to provide the reusable components that may be resuable in similar works. This may include libray, some scripts, jupyter notebooks (sample calculation and other information), program with UI(for easy access), django server.

For documentation the notebooks are supposed to provide use cases and they may be used for test cases too.
