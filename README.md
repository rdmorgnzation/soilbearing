BLCalc
==========
This is the program to calculate bearing capacity directly from Excel Sheets(containing SPT datas).

More Details
==========
The actual intent of the project is not clear. It is expected to take SPT borehole data(excel sheet, may later summary sheets too) and compute BC(Bearing Capacity) using various methods. Those include, by shear criteria, deflection criteria and FEM (PLASIX) and outputs that can be used by external programs. Calculation related to liquifaction may be done on those datas . Actually it is for final year project so the it may be not general as expected. It is to provide the reusable components that may be resuable in similar works. This may include libray, some scripts, jupyter notebooks (sample calculation and other information), program with UI(for easy access), django server[not planned]. And the development is targeted for windows only (for now).

For documentation the notebooks are supposed to provide use cases and they may be used for test cases too.
